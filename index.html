      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I am a senior at Cornell University studying Computer Science and Robotics. I am passionate about using AI and software engineering to build solutions, especially ones for public benefit.</p>

      <p>Currently, I am building an AI-powered journaling app startup, Scribe AI, where I am leading the development of the backend. Previously, I worked as a Software Development Engineer intern at Amazon, where I created a full-stack application to assist with their asset management system.</p>
        
      <p>When not working, you’ll most likely find me outside playing sports, or inside gaming. I also love to read and cook.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Co-Founder, Backend Lead @ Scribe AI (Startup)</h3>
        <p>As Co-Founder and Backend Lead at Scribe AI, I’ve been leading 
          the development and integration of the backend for an AI-powered
           journaling application. I designed and maintained a SQLite database 
           using SQLAlchemy to store user information, and implemented Flask 
           routes to handle HTTP requests between the frontend and backend. 
           Additionally, I integrated WebSockets to enable real-time audio 
           transfer between the website and the AI agent.</p>

        <h3>Software Development Engineer Intern @ Amazon</h3>
        <p>During my time as a Software Development Engineer Intern at Amazon, 
          I developed and deployed a full-stack application to streamline manual 
          asset creation, saving my team hours of work each week. I built the 
          frontend using HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and React, and implemented the 
          backend using Java, DynamoDB, and GraphQL to manage data and connect to 
          the frontend. I also created detailed design documents and presented them 
          to stakeholders to guide the implementation process.</p>

        <h3>Advisory & Governance Board Member @ Cornell Blockchain</h3>
        <p>As an Advisory & Governance Board Member of the Cornell Blockchain Club,
           I conducted market research to support Web3 startup companies in improving
            their business strategies. I used SQL to query data related to 
            cryptocurrency prices, liquidity pools, and other key analytics.
            I also explored practical applications of blockchain technology to
             identify areas where it could replace or enhance existing systems.</p>

        <p>For BluffBot, an AI-powered poker bot, I implemented Deep Q-Learning using
           PyTorch to train an agent capable of playing two-player Texas Hold’em Poker.
            I leveraged PettingZoo’s poker environment to facilitate training and enable
             the agent to compete against both human players and other AI agents.
